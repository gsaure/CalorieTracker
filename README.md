# CalorieTracker

Everyone has heard about the dreaded "Freshman-15", where in your first year of university due to the huge transition from high school to university you gain 15 pounds from stuff like stress. Well, that happened to me, but with COVID-19 it sort of became a Freshman-30!

I spent this summer trying to lose weight, and am proud to say I lost **50 pounds** going from 195 to 145! ðŸŽŠ

Calorie counting was one of my main strategies to complete this as it gave me some sense of control on how I'm losing weight. I developed and used this program to track my progress.

Use the following commands when running the app. Note that there's 1 set for txt files and the other for csv files. The app will write data into these types respectively.
- list eaten <name> <date> =    List foods eaten on a given date.
- list weights <name> =         List the weight history for a user.
- list dates <name> =            List the dates for which there are calorie counts
- list foods =                  List all calorie data for known foods
- lookup calories <food> =      Look up calories for a given food.
- lookup weight <name> <date> = Look up weight for a given date.
- total <name> <date> =       Calculate total calories for a given user and date.
- newuser <name> =          Create a new user.
- eaten <name> <food> <weight> = Add a food data for today.
- weighed <name> <weight> =     Add weight data for today.
